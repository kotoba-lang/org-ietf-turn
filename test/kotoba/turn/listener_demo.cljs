;; Not a unit test — an EXECUTABLE end-to-end demo that must genuinely pass
;; when run. Mirrors the rigor `kotoba-lang/dtn`'s
;; `test/kotoba/dtn/transport/tcp_demo.cljs` established for that repo's own
;; first "does this actually move real bytes" namespace: PASS/FAIL printed
;; per scenario, a final "RESULT: N/3 scenarios passed" line, and
;; `js/process.exit` 0 iff all 3 passed (else 1).
;;
;; What this proves that a plain unit test on `kotoba.turn.listener`'s own
;; functions could not: this demo builds every client-side STUN message BY
;; HAND, directly from `kotoba.turn.stun`'s primitives (encode-header /
;; push-attr / set-attr-length / append-message-integrity /
;; append-fingerprint — the exact same "how do I build a signed request"
;; sequence this repo's README already documents) over a REAL
;; `node:dgram` socket the demo controls directly — never by calling into
;; `kotoba.turn.listener`'s own internal handler functions. That is the
;; only honest way to prove the LISTENER's own parsing/dispatch/relay logic
;; is real: an assertion that only exercised the listener's internals from
;; the same process, without a real socket round-trip, could pass even if
;; the wire-format handling were subtly broken.
;;
;; The "peer" is a second real `node:dgram` socket, deliberately NOT
;; TURN-aware in any way (no STUN/ChannelData framing on its side at all)
;; — the honest simulation of an arbitrary UDP endpoint (a game server, a
;; SIP media peer, anything) that a TURN relay exists to reach. It just
;; echoes back whatever bytes arrive, with "-echo" appended, so replies are
;; trivially distinguishable from requests.
;;
;; Run from this repo's root (nbb, not `clojure -M:test` — this is `.cljs`,
;; real socket I/O, see `kotoba.turn.listener`'s own namespace docstring for
;; why that split exists):
;;
;;   nbb --classpath "src:test:../bytes/src" test/kotoba/turn/listener_demo.cljs
;;
;; Scenario 1 proves the full authenticated Allocate -> CreatePermission ->
;; Send-indication data path in BOTH directions: client -> peer (hop 1,
;; asserted via the peer's own raw socket actually receiving the payload)
;; AND peer -> client (hop 2, the harder direction most integrations get
;; lazy about — asserted via the client's own raw socket actually receiving
;; a real STUN Data indication carrying the peer's echoed reply).
;;
;; Scenario 2 proves the ChannelBind fast path is a SEPARATE real code path,
;; not just a re-skin of scenario 1: binds a channel number, sends the
;; client -> peer leg as raw ChannelData (no STUN framing at all) instead of
;; a Send indication, and confirms the peer -> client return leg arrives as
;; ChannelData too (not a Data indication) — checked with
;; `kotoba.turn.demux/classify-datagram` on the raw bytes the client socket
;; actually received, not just by trusting `kotoba.turn.channeldata/decode`
;; to succeed (a STUN message could coincidentally decode-shaped-wrong; the
;; demux check is what actually distinguishes the two wire formats).
;;
;; Scenario 3 proves the auth boundary: an Allocate request signed with a
;; credential minted under the WRONG shared secret (a different value than
;; the listener was started with) is rejected — no allocation is created
;; (checked directly against the listener's own exposed state atom, not
;; just "we got an error response"), and a subsequent Send indication from
;; that same unauthenticated address relays nothing (the peer's receive
;; count is unchanged) — mirroring the rigor `dtn`'s own auth-rejection
;; scenario (4b, forged-signature bundle) established: reject the direct
;; response AND confirm the attacker gains no side effect.
