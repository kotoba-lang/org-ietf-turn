;; kotoba.turn.listener — the real UDP relay listener: the piece every other
;; namespace in this repo (`kotoba.turn.stun` / `kotoba.turn.credential` /
;; `kotoba.turn.allocation` / `kotoba.turn.channeldata` / `kotoba.turn.demux`)
;; was deliberately pure/socket-free so a listener could wire them together
;; against real `node:dgram` sockets without any of them needing to change.
;; This is that wiring. Before this namespace, this repo was "the protocol +
;; state contract a future listener phase must implement against" (README);
;; after it, `start-listener!` actually relays real UDP datagrams between a
;; client and a peer end to end (RFC 8656 §5-§12).
;;
;; `.cljs`, NOT `.cljc` — like `kotoba.dtn.transport.tcp` in
;; `kotoba-lang/dtn` (the sibling repo this namespace's shape was modeled
;; after), real socket I/O only exists on a Node-hosted ClojureScript
;; runtime (nbb, in this repo's test/demo tooling). `clojure -M:test` cannot
;; load `.cljs` files at all, so this file can never regress the existing
;; 41-test/94-assertion pure `.cljc` suite — see this repo's README.
;;
;; FIVE-TUPLE SIMPLIFICATION (read this before touching :turn/five-tuple
;; below). RFC 8656's allocation five-tuple is (client IP, client port,
;; server IP, server port, transport). This listener runs exactly ONE
;; server-facing UDP socket on one port, so the server-address half of the
;; tuple is a process-wide constant for every allocation this listener will
;; ever create — it carries zero information as a map KEY. This namespace
;; therefore indexes `:allocations`/`:relay-sockets` by just
;; `{:address <client-ip-string> :port <client-port>}` (see `client-key`,
;; below) rather than a literal 5-field map. This is a real, disclosed
;; simplification specific to "one listener, one UDP transport" — a future
;; listener phase that also opened a TCP-relayed-client-facing socket (out
;; of scope here, see the bottom of this docstring) would need to widen this
;; key back out to a genuine 5-tuple (adding :transport) so a UDP and a TCP
;; client sharing the same IP:port pair on their respective transports don't
;; collide.
;;
;; STATE. One atom: `{:allocations {client-key allocation} :relay-sockets
;; {client-key dgram-socket}}`. `allocation` is exactly the plain EDN map
;; `kotoba.turn.allocation/allocate` returns/updates — this namespace never
;; reimplements allocation/permission/channel-binding logic, it only calls
;; into `kotoba.turn.allocation`'s pure functions and stores what comes
;; back. `relay-sockets` holds the live `node:dgram` socket opened for that
;; client's allocation (the "relayed transport address" side) — this is the
;; one piece of real, mutable, non-pure state this repo has ever needed, and
;; it lives here, not in `kotoba.turn.allocation`.
;;
;; PEER-ADDRESS SHAPE — a deliberate, disclosed choice within what
;; `kotoba.turn.allocation` itself documents as an opaque, caller-chosen
;; value (`create-permission`'s docstring: "typically just the peer's IP,
;; per §9 — permissions are IP-only, not IP:port"; `channel-bind` never
;; commits to a shape at all). This namespace uses TWO different shapes for
;; the two different RFC 8656 concepts, because they need different
;; information to do their real job here:
;;   - permissions (`:turn/permissions`) are keyed by peer IP ONLY — a
;;     4-int byte vector like `[8 8 8 8]` — matching RFC 8656 §9's actual
;;     semantics (a permission authorizes a peer HOST, any port).
;;   - channel bindings (`:turn/channel-bindings`) are keyed by channel
;;     number and store a FULL `{:ip [.. .. .. ..] :port n}` peer transport
;;     address, because ChannelData framing (`kotoba.turn.channeldata`)
;;     carries no address info on the wire at all — the only way this
;;     listener can know which exact port to relay a client's ChannelData
;;     payload to is by remembering the full address the ChannelBind
;;     request supplied.
;; Per RFC 8656 §11 ("a channel binding also acts as an implicit channel
;; permission"), a successful ChannelBind here also installs/refreshes a
;; plain-IP permission for the same peer (see `handle-channel-bind!`) — so
;; the peer's *first* return datagram doesn't get dropped by the permission
;; check on the relay-socket's inbound path (below) for lack of a separate
;; CreatePermission call. Its lifetime is the normal
;; `alloc/default-permission-lifetime-s` (300s), independent of the
;; channel's own 600s lifetime — same "independent expiry" model
;; `kotoba.turn.allocation`'s own tests already pin; this listener does not
;; keep the two in lockstep beyond that one implicit install.
;;
;; AUTHENTICATION SCOPE. Only the Allocate request is cryptographically
;; verified here (USERNAME + MESSAGE-INTEGRITY against a server-configured
;; `:shared-secret`, via `kotoba.turn.credential/verify-credential` +
;; `kotoba.turn.stun/verify-message-integrity` — see `handle-allocate!` for
;; exactly how those two compose). Refresh / CreatePermission / ChannelBind
;; are authorized purely by "does a live allocation exist for this client's
;; observed source address/port" — they do NOT re-verify MESSAGE-INTEGRITY.
;; This is narrower than a production TURN server (coturn verifies MI on
;; every request) and is a disclosed limitation, not an oversight: an
;; on-path or source-address-spoofing attacker who can inject a UDP
;; datagram appearing to originate from an already-allocated client's
;; address/port could manipulate that allocation's permissions/channel
;; bindings without re-presenting credentials. Closing this gap (verifying
;; MI on every request type, not just Allocate) is straightforward future
;; work — every request already carries a real MESSAGE-INTEGRITY attribute
;; in the wire format (see `test/kotoba/turn/listener_demo.cljs`, which
;; signs every request including Refresh/CreatePermission/ChannelBind) —
;; but is out of scope for this phase to keep the reviewable surface
;; matched to what was actually asked for.
;;
;; WHAT THIS NAMESPACE COVERS (real, not simulated):
;;   - Allocate (verified) -> opens a real ephemeral-port `node:dgram`
;;     relay socket, replies with XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS / XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS /
;;     LIFETIME.
;;   - Refresh (including lifetime-0 -> delete, closing the relay socket).
;;   - CreatePermission (one or more XOR-PEER-ADDRESS attributes per
;;     request).
;;   - ChannelBind (range-validated via `kotoba.turn.allocation/channel-bind`
;;     itself; also installs an implicit permission, see above).
;;   - Send indication -> real client -> peer relay over the allocation's
;;     relay socket, gated by `alloc/permission-active?`.
;;   - ChannelData from the client -> real client -> peer relay via
;;     `alloc/peer-for-channel`.
;;   - The OTHER direction (this is the direction most integrations get
;;     lazy about, and the task that produced this namespace was explicit
;;     that skipping it is not acceptable): each relay socket's own
;;     `"message"` handler relays real peer -> client traffic back out the
;;     MAIN listening socket, as a Data indication when no channel is bound
;;     for that exact peer address, or as (lighter) ChannelData when one is
;;     — gated by the same `alloc/permission-active?` check RFC 8656 §9
;;     requires for inbound-from-peer traffic, not just outbound.
;;   - A periodic expiry sweep (`alloc/expired?`) that closes and drops
;;     allocations whose lifetime has actually elapsed, reusing the pure
;;     expiry check rather than reimplementing it.
;;
;; WHAT THIS NAMESPACE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER (same gaps the founding
;; ADR and every earlier phase already named — this listener does not
;; silently close any of them):
;;   - The long-term credential mechanism (RFC 8489 §9.2) — only the
;;     coturn-style ephemeral short-term scheme
;;     (`kotoba.turn.credential`) is implemented.
;;   - IPv6 — `kotoba.turn.stun`'s XOR-address codec is IPv4-only
;;     (family 0x01), and so is this listener's `ip-str->vec`/`ip-vec->str`.
;;   - Per-client allocation quotas / DoS / rate limits of any kind.
;;   - `REQUESTED-TRANSPORT` / `DONT-FRAGMENT` / `EVEN-PORT` /
;;     `RESERVATION-TOKEN` request-validation logic — an Allocate request's
;;     REQUESTED-TRANSPORT attribute (if present) is never inspected; this
;;     listener always allocates a UDP relay socket.
;;   - Exact RFC 8489 §14.8 ERROR-CODE payload fidelity beyond the minimal
;;     shape `kotoba.turn.stun/encode-error-code` already provides (class +
;;     number + UTF-8 reason phrase) — error RESPONSE TYPE codes for
;;     Refresh/CreatePermission/ChannelBind failures are derived locally
;;     here (`error-response-type`) via the same request-type|0x0110 = error
;;     -type arithmetic the codec's own `allocate-error` constant already
;;     encodes (0x0003|0x0110 = 0x0113 — checked against that existing
;;     constant, not invented from nothing), since `kotoba.turn.stun` itself
;;     only defines the one (Allocate) error-response type constant. Error
;;     responses here never carry MESSAGE-INTEGRITY (only success responses
;;     to a verified Allocate do) — a disclosed simplification, not a
;;     completed long-term-credential NONCE/REALM challenge flow.
;;   - TCP or TLS on the client-facing side — this listener's main socket is
;;     UDP (`udp4`) only, matching this repo's existing IPv4-only scope.

  "Start the TURN relay: binds a `udp4` `node:dgram` socket on `:host`
   (default `\"0.0.0.0\"` — accept client datagrams on any interface, the
   usual server posture) / `:port` (0 = OS-assigned ephemeral port, the
   default) and begins dispatching received datagrams per this namespace's
   docstring. `:shared-secret` (required — throws synchronously if omitted)
   is the server-side secret
   `kotoba.turn.credential/mint-credential`/`verify-credential` use for the
   ephemeral short-term credential scheme; it must never be sent to a
   client.

   `:relay-host` (default `\"127.0.0.1\"`) is the address every per-
   allocation relay socket (see `handle-allocate!`) binds to — deliberately
   NOT defaulted to the `0.0.0.0` wildcard, because a relayed transport
   address of literally `0.0.0.0` reported in XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS would be
   non-functional in any context. `127.0.0.1` is an honest default for
   local dev/demo use (this repo's own demo runs entirely on loopback); a
   real deployment doing actual NAT traversal for remote peers MUST
   override this to the server's real, externally-reachable IP (the same
   \"internal bind address can differ from the externally-reachable
   relay address\" split every production TURN server, e.g. coturn's
   `--relay-ip`, needs — this listener does not attempt to auto-detect a
   public IP).

   Binding a UDP socket is inherently asynchronous (the OS only assigns
   the actual port once `bind` completes), so this returns a
   `Promise<handle>` rather than a bare handle — callers (see
   `test/kotoba/turn/listener_demo.cljs`) `p/let`/`.then` it. `handle` is
   `{:state <atom, the state described in this namespace's docstring>
     :socket <the main node:dgram socket, e.g. for callers who want to
              read (.address socket) themselves> :port <the actual bound
              port> :sweep-id <the js/setInterval id, for stop-listener!>}`.

   `:sweep-interval-ms` (default 5000) controls how often the expiry sweep
   (`sweep-expired!`) runs; exposed mainly so a demo/test doesn't have to
   wait a full 5s to observe an expiry."
