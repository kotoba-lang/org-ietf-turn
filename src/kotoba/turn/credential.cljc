;; kotoba.turn.credential — TURN ephemeral-credential mint/verify, coturn
;; `use-auth-secret` scheme (the de-facto WebRTC standard; see RFC 7635 and
;; https://github.com/coturn/coturn/wiki/turnserver#turn-rest-api).
;;
;;   username   = "<expiry-unix-ts>:<user>"
;;   credential = base64( HMAC-SHA1( shared-secret, username ) )
;;
;; The HMAC-SHA1 primitive is reader-conditional: the JVM branch does the
;; RFC 2104 ipad/opad construction itself (identical shape to
;; `kotoba.turn.sha1/hmac-sha1`) but delegates the actual digest to the
;; platform's `java.security.MessageDigest` SHA-1 (audited, JIT-compiled —
;; and, unlike `javax.crypto.Mac`/`SecretKeySpec`, it has no objection to an
;; empty key, which HMAC itself allows per RFC 2104 §2); the ClojureScript
;; branch uses the pure `kotoba.turn.sha1` implementation (no native crypto
;; dependency, works in-browser or under Node without polyfills).
;; `credential_test.clj` cross-checks both paths against the same RFC 2202
;; vectors AND against each other directly (the pure impl is plain portable
;; code, so it's callable from JVM tests too) to pin them to identical bytes.

;; expired / bad-signature) and hand back the parsed room/player on success —
;; a richer contract than the generic `mint-credential`/`verify-credential`
